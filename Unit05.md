**Unit 5: New World Slave Societies** <span id="5"></span> 

*New World slave societies were highly varied colonial outposts of
powerful European empires. Many of these colonies turned to African
slave labor after two other sources of labor – native Amerindians and
European indentured servants – succumbed to death and disease. Although
African laborers were used throughout the Caribbean, mainland North
America and Central and South America, the nature of enslavement and the
role of African laborers in each society varied widely. There were many
reasons for this. First, the nature of slavery depended upon the goods
being produced; slavery on sugar plantations in Barbados, for example,
was far different than slavery in the gold mines of Peru. Second, New
World societies often perceived slavery (and slaves) differently. In
some colonies, for example, manumission (release from slavery) was more
common and accepted than in others. And third, many New World societies
were shaped by their importation of slaves from specific regions in
Africa. Rice planters in the Carolinas, for example, wanted to import
African ethnic groups who had experience growing rice in Africa.*  
  
 **In this unit, we will compare and contrast the slave societies that
emerged in the New World between the 16<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>
centuries. We will consider how African ethnicities, plantation
production, and colonists’ perception of enslavement all contributed to
the development of highly varied New World slave societies.**

    spoke English, and the emergence of strong kinship bonds among
    enslaved people.
