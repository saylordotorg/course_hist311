**Unit 3: Early Slaving Voyages** <span id="3"></span> 
*The earliest European slaving voyages began in the first part of the
16<sup>th</sup> century. Spanish and Portuguese traders purchased slaves
from Upper Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and the Bight of Biafra,
before embarking to New World destinations. During this time, most
African slaves were sold in the Spanish Caribbean, with the gold mines
on Hispaniola serving as a major buyer. A few decades later, Cartagena
emerged as a major slave trading port on the Spanish American mainland.
In the latter 1500s, the slave trade increased markedly because of the
expansion of sugar production in Brazil; slaves bound for Brazil
accounted for 40 percent of the slave traffic and Brazil supplied nearly
all of the sugar consumed in Europe. The English and Dutch also became
involved in the slave trade in the 1560s. John Hawkins, an English
privateer, hijacked a Portuguese slave ship and sold the slaves on
Hispaniola in 1563. Later, Hawkins made other voyages to Africa and the
West Indies supplied with Queen Elizabeth I’s ships and funded by
wealthy English investors.*  
  
 **Beginning in the 1640s, the Atlantic slave trade began to change
dramatically for many reasons. The plantation sugar complex had spread
throughout much of the Caribbean, fueling the demand for African slaves.
Sugar production continued to increase in Brazil and gold discoveries
there also spurred the need for enslaved labor. Meanwhile, in Europe,
sugar consumption continued to rise. By 1690, 30,000 Africans were being
brought to New World destinations through the Atlantic slave trade each
year.*  
  
 *The Atlantic slave trade reached its height in the 18<sup>th</sup>
century. English, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Danish, and French traders
all competed for African slaves in the 1700s. The Portuguese and the
English dominated the trade and often sold their human chattel to
foreign buyers. Moreover, much of the trade was buoyed by European
protectionist economic policies and the prohibition of commercial
monopolies. By 1750, the Atlantic slave trade had expanded
exponentially; over 67,000 Africans were taken to the Americas per
year.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the earliest slave voyages from Africa to
the Spanish Caribbean and the Spanish mainland. We will also examine how
the expansion of the sugar plantation regime in Brazil and the
involvement of English and Dutch traders affected the Atlantic slave
trade.**

    In this 1587 document, a Spanish cleric proclaims that “a thousand
    acts of robbery and violence are committed in the course of
    bartering and carrying off Negroes” in the slave trade. As European
    powers were becoming increasingly involved in buying and selling
    Africans, Mercado dismisses the trade as the product of robbery,
    deception, and violence.
