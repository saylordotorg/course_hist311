**Unit 4: Empires and Slaving** <span id="4"></span> 
*In the latter 18<sup>th</sup> century, proponents of the Atlantic slave
trade defended the commerce by arguing that slavery and the slave trade
had existed in Africa for centuries. This was correct. Many African
societies included slaves, but slavery was often akin to domestic or
indentured servitude. Slaves were not enslaved for life or treated as
chattel, as in New World societies.*  
  
 **There were several slave trades in Africa. The trans-Saharan slave
trade transported enslaved men and women across the Sahara Desert; most
served as prostitutes, soldiers, or servants. Two other trade systems –
the Red Sea and Indian Ocean trades – brought African slaves to the
Middle East. When European traders began buying slaves in western
Africa, they were capitalizing on an existing system. The men, women,
and children purchased by European traders were often prisoners of war
or criminals. However, as European demand for Africans increased
exponentially, so did the incidents of kidnapping by African
slave-catchers. As a result, slaving factories were created along the
western coast of Africa; they served as holding areas where African
slave dealers could sell captives to European traders.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the relationship between African
slavery, the African slave trades, and the Atlantic slave trade. We will
also study how Europeans’ exploitation of existing slave trade networks
affected African societies.**
