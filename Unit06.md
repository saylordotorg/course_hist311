**Unit 6: The Middle Passage** <span id="6"></span> 
*Over 30,000 slaving voyages brought Africans to the Americas. These
captive Africans reached the New World through what is called the*
Middle Passage*. During the Middle Passage, a transatlantic crossing
that frequently lasted between one and three months, it is estimated
that nearly 20 percent of Africans on board perished. According to
regulations, approximately 350 captives were allowed to be transported,
but some slavers packed upwards of 800 slaves below deck. Men, women,
and children were stripped naked and branded before being forced to lie
down, in their own filth, and chained to one another. Crewmembers beat,
raped, or otherwise tortured their captives during the journey. In
addition, many Africans died of disease, dehydration, or suicide. Some
Africans were able to resist their captors; many rebellions were incited
on board slave ships. When the slaving vessels finally moored in New
World ports, Africans were quarantined (for disease) and then sold at
auction to merchants and planters.*  
  
 **In this unit, we will examine the horrific voyage of the Middle
Passage. We will study conditions on board slave ships, the treatment of
slaves during the Middle Passage, and the auctions and quarantines that
captives endured when they arrived in the New World.**

    States for most of his life. Although not often read by modern day
    readers, Brinch’s memoir offers a horrifying view of the Middle
    Passage that other writers merely gesture toward.
