Course Syllabus for "HIST311: The Age of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1500-1900"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to the history of the Atlantic slave
trade from 1500 to 1900. You will learn about the slave trade, its
causes, and its effects on Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The course
will be structured chronologically and geographically; each unit with
focus on a particular aspect of the Atlantic slave trade. Each unit will
include representative primary-source documents that illustrate
important overarching political, economic, and social themes, such as
slavery and the slave trade within African societies, the growth of
plantation societies in the New World, the advent of European slave
dealing in western Africa, the simultaneous growth of European empires
and the Atlantic slave trade, the nature of slave trading and the Middle
Passage, and the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in the nineteenth
century. By the end of the course, you will understand how the Atlantic
slave trade began as a fledgling enterprise of the English, Portuguese,
and Spanish in the 1500s and why, by the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century,
the trade dominated Atlantic societies and economies.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this provides background information
about the origins of the Atlantic slave trade; this unit will help you
understand the more advanced, exploratory material in the latter units.
You will also need to complete:  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the materials in each unit and consider the study
questions in the instructions sections.  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% of higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **65.75**
**hours.** Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories, determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 7.5 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.25 hours)
on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 4.25 hours) on Tuesday night;
etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As you study each resource, make sure to take
