**Unit 1: Origins of The Atlantic Slave Trade** <span id="1"></span> 
*Slavery existed in Africa long before European contact. In fact,
slavery within African societies and slave trade routes across the
Sahara Desert, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean had been in place for
centuries. However, the beginning of the European-dominated Atlantic
slave trade in the 16<sup>th</sup> century had a new and profound impact
on African peoples. In all, historians estimate that approximately 12
million Africans were transported to the New World through the Atlantic
slave trade.*  
         
 **That the Atlantic World and the Atlantic slave trade both emerged in
the 1500s was not a coincidence. European empires that sought to explore
and colonize territories in the New World also attempted to forge
lucrative commercial networks in the Atlantic littoral (the regions that
touched the Atlantic Ocean). Gradually, a** *triangular trade came to
define the Atlantic World; ships departed from Europe, sailed to western
Africa to trade, embarked to the Caribbean and South America to sell
slaves, and then returned to Europe laden with New World produce.
Although the trade routes often varied, western Africa remained an
important destination for European traders who bought and sold gold,
ivory, cloth, and African slaves.*  
         
 **In this unit, we will study European exploration and colonization as
impetuses for the development of the Atlantic slave trade. We will also
examine the development of the Atlantic economy, of which the trade in
Africans became a critical component.**
