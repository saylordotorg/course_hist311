**Unit 7: Abolition** <span id="7"></span> 
*That the Atlantic slave trade would end was never a given. However, a
number of forces in the late 1700s and early 1800s paved the way for the
enactment of legislation prohibiting the slave trade. Religious groups
(namely Quakers and evangelical Protestants) advocated for an end to the
slave trade, a system of commerce that they believed to be regressive
and morally evil. Enlightenment ideas, particularly notions of the
progress and liberty of mankind, buttressed arguments in favor of
abolition. The rise of free trade ideology put mercantilist policies –
of which the slave trade was one – on the defensive. In addition, the
dissolution of European empires during the Age of Revolutions
contributed to rising opposition to what had been an imperially
sanctioned commerce. While the movement to end the slave trade gathered
steam, especially in Britain, America, and France, the abolition
movement also encountered a number of impediments. The continued
profitability of the Atlantic slave trade and sugar production stalled
abolition on several fronts. However, when countries began to view the
Atlantic slave trade as an* *act of piracy and an illegitimate form of
commerce, abolition was accepted and enacted. Denmark was the first
nation to abolish its Atlantic slave trade, in 1803, and Cuba was the
last, in 1866. In the interim, however, slave trading in the Atlantic
persisted and, in some cases, even escalated.*  
  
 **In this unit, we will examine the social, political, and economic
causes of abolition. We will also study the obstacles to abolition in
Europe, Africa, and the Americas. In addition, we will compare and
contrast abolition movements and consider how the end of the Atlantic
slave trade impacted labor systems and the world economy.**
