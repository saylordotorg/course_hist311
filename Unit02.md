**Unit 2: The Enslavement of Africans** <span id="2"></span> 
*Beginning in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, Africans were brought to the
Americas to serve as enslaved laborers on plantations and in mines.
However, Africans were not the first laborers to be used in the New
World for that purpose. Portuguese and Spanish colonizers had utilized
indentured servitude and enslaved local Amerindian peoples. However,
when disease depleted the Amerindian slaves and indentured European
servants, African laborers became a viable alternative. Africans were
accustomed to a tropical climate, were familiar with agricultural
production, and seemed resistant to disease. Gradually, specific African
ethnic groups were brought to the English, Danish, Dutch, or French West
Indies, or to Spanish or Portuguese America as captive slaves.*  
         
 **In this unit, we will examine why European colonizers turned to
imported Africans as their main source of labor on plantations and in
gold and silver mines. We will also study which African ethnic groups
were imported into particular New World colonies.**
